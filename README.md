# cfl-library
Commons functions library is a set of functions  commonly used in my C projects.
The goal is to be an abstraction and simplification layer.

Isn't intend to be a complete solution to meet other projects. However, feel free to use and improve it.

Implemented features:
* Array
* Buffer
* Iterator
* List
* Lock
* Synched List
* Socket
* String
* Thread
